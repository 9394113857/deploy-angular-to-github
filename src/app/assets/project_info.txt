ng serve --port 4200

The Angular CLI will build and serve your project on the specified port. 
Once the compilation is complete, you can access the project in your web browser 
by navigating to http://localhost:<port-number> (e.g., http://localhost:4200).

Remember that if the specified port is already in use by another application, 
you will need to choose a different port number.

Keep in mind that the Angular CLI provides many other options for customizing the development server. 
You can find more information by running ng serve --help in the terminal.
